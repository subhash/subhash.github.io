This is a great resource for someone starting with Clojure. The site presents problems (of varying difficulty) and provides test cases to check for all sorts of edge-cases (and algorithmic complexity too!). The code golf feature challenges you to arrive at the shortest possible solution. Though some may be inspired to take it down the [Brainf**k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) route, this can also help you find the most idiomatic way to express yourself in Clojure. May the force be with you!
