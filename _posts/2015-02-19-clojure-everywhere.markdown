It is not everyday when you encounter a programming language which can be used all over the stack - in the client, server and DB. This fact fascinates me to no end and [Clojure Everywhere](https://github.com/subhash/clj-stack) is a result of that fascination. It is a tutorial-slash-sample-project that guides a newbie to the world of possibilities in Clojure (hopefully :smile:). Enjoy!
