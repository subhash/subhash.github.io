When I first used Lisp, it seemed magical and yet somehow misplaced in this earthly setting where eveything is not a list. "Everything is an object" seemed more convincing and so, I grew up on a strict diet of C++ classes and Java interfaces. But when Clojure came along, it seemed worth trying and by the time ClojureScript and Datomic were released, the world of functional programming seemed to beckon.

I think I have read enough ramblings and rants that I think it's time I start giving back

Hence the disclojures ..
